<h3> A Little Bit About Me! </h3>

<h4> Some Updates on Hurricane Dorian </h4>
<p> I don't really know what else to say so I'm going to start pasting random text. <br> <i>Hurricane Dorian</i> was finally inching away from the northern Bahamas after crawling over them for days, leaving catastrophic flooding and damage as it pounded the same areas over and over at an excruciating slow and nearly unprecedented pace.</p>

<p>Dorian -- now a <b>Category 2</b> storm with maximum sustained winds of 110 mph -- was growing in size late Tuesday morning, with tropical-storm-force winds now extending up to 175 miles out. <br>Its winds and outer rain bands already are hitting parts of Florida's Atlantic coast, which will feel more of the storm over the coming two days.</p>
